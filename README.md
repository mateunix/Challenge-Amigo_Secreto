# Challenge - Secret Friend 🕵️‍♂️

In this challenge, an application was developed using **JavaScript** that allows users to enter friends' names into a list and then perform a random draw to determine who the "secret friend" is.

The user adds names through a text field and an "Add" button.

The entered names are displayed in a visible list on the page, and when ready, a "Draw Friend" button selects one of the names at random and displays the result on the screen.

## **Features:**

- ✍️ **Add names:** Users will type a friend's name into a text field and add it to a visible list by clicking "Add".
- 🛂 **Input validation:** If the text field is empty, the program will show an alert requesting a valid name.
- 📋 **View the list:** The entered names will appear in a list below the input field.
- 🎲 **Random draw:** By clicking the "Draw Friend" button, one name from the list will be randomly selected and displayed on the page.
